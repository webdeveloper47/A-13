1. app: This folder contains the core of your Laravel application. It houses the application's models, controllers, and other essential classes. The app folder is where you define your application's business logic and implement the functionality specific to your project.

2. bootstrap: The bootstrap folder contains files that are responsible for bootstrapping and initializing the Laravel framework. It includes the app.php file, which sets up the application and loads the necessary components.

3. config: The config folder contains configuration files for your Laravel application. It includes various files where you can define settings for your database, caching, mail services, and more. These files provide a convenient way to manage different aspects of your application's behavior.

4. database: The database folder is used for database-related files. It includes database migrations, which are files that define changes to your database schema. Additionally, it contains seeders, which are used to populate the database with dummy data for testing and development purposes.

5. public: The public folder is the web server's document root for your Laravel application. It contains the entry point index.php file, which is the starting point of your application. The public folder also hosts publicly accessible assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files.

6. resources: The resources folder is where you store non-PHP resources such as views, language files, and frontend assets. It includes subfolders for views (views), localization (lang), and frontend assets such as JavaScript (js) and CSS (css). These resources are used to build the user interface of your application.

7. routes: The routes folder contains all the route definitions for your application. It includes the web.php file, which defines routes for web-based interactions, and the api.php file, which defines routes for API endpoints. You can create additional files to organize your routes further based on their purpose or module.

8. storage: The storage folder is used to store various files generated by your application. It includes subfolders for application logs (logs), file uploads (app/public), and framework-generated files like cache and session data. It's important to note that files within the storage folder should not be publicly accessible.

9. tests: The tests folder is where you write your application's automated tests. Laravel provides a robust testing framework that allows you to write unit tests, feature tests, and more. The tests folder includes subfolders to organize different types of tests, making it easier to maintain and execute test suites.

10. vendor: The vendor folder contains all the dependencies installed via Composer, the PHP package manager. It includes third-party libraries and packages that your application relies on. The vendor folder should not be modified directly; instead, you manage dependencies through the composer.json file.
